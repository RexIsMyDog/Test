<p>Rex is kind dog. He loves barking, sleeping and being lazy, his pelt is black and brown<p/>
<p>He always sleeps til he sees me then wakes up running torwards me.</p>
<p>When he thinks he is alone he looks out of the windows hoping for someone to come home</p>
<p>If nobody is petting him when he is close he makes small barks that sound cute</p>
<p>If you have a dog and want to show it? <em>If so</em> contact the owner at <a href="mailto:LazyRex@gmai.com">LazyRex@gmail.com</a></p>
