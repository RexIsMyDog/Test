<p><u>Ripple potato chips are cut by a serrated blade.</u> The potato slices are washed to get rid of the <b>starch</b> that seeps onto the edge of the potato once it is <b>cut</b>. The potatoes are then put into a vat of vegetable oil that always bubbles at 190ºC (375ºF). As the potato chips cook the <b>water inside them</b> turns to steam.</p>
